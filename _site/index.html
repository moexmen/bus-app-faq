<h3 id="app">App</h3>

<h4 id="1-what-if-the-app-shows-the-bus-has-not-started-the-route-and-its-already-close-to-my-pick-updrop-off-time">1. What if the app shows the bus has not started the route and it’s already close to my pick-up/drop-off time?</h4>

<p>Please still proceed with the pre-arranged schedule and check with the bus driver if he has forgotten to turn on the application.</p>

<h4 id="2-why-does-the-app-show-a-much-later-time-of-arrival-even-though-the-bus-icon-is-near-my-stop">2. Why does the app show a much later time of arrival even though the bus icon is near my stop?</h4>

<p>Even though the bus is near your stop, there may be other stops it has to travel to first before going to yours. The app takes into account all stops on that day between the current position of the bus and your stop. Please be at your child’s stop at the agreed time and use the ETA provided in the app only as a guide.</p>

<h4 id="3-what-if-my-stop-location-is-wrongly-indicated-on-the-app">3. What if my stop location is wrongly indicated on the app?</h4>

<p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:schoolbus@estl.sg">schoolbus@estl.sg</a> with a screenshot indicating where the correct location should be.</p>

<h4 id="4-who-should-i-inform-if-my-child-is-not-taking-the-school-bus-today">4. Who should I inform if my child is not taking the school bus today?</h4>

<h4 id="1-why-is-moe-doing-this">1. Why is MOE doing this?</h4>
<p>MOE has heard feedback from many of you through various channels. This is a first step towards addressing some of the issues brought up via improving the service delivery of school buses. The team working on this is an in-house engineering team in MOE. By starting with a simple application, we hope to test the need for this technological solution and figure out how best to serve you.</p>

<h4 id="2-does-the-app-work-on-all-mobile-devices">2. Does the app work on all mobile devices?</h4>
<p>The app is designed to work on both iOS and Android phones. However, should you encounter any issues with installation or usage, please do not hesitate to reach out to us via email to <a href="mailto:schoolbus@estl.sg">schoolbus@estl.sg</a></p>

<h4 id="3-why-is-the-installation-process-so-tedious">3. Why is the installation process so tedious?</h4>
<p>As the app is in the initial testing phase, it is not yet available on Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Please bear with us for the time being as we improve the application and move towards getting them on the official application stores.</p>

<h4 id="4-can-i-install-the-app-on-my-computer">4. Can I install the app on my computer?</h4>
<p>Currently the app is intended to be installed on mobile devices only. If access via the computer is something you think is important, please let us know via the support channels available.</p>

<h4 id="5-how-was-my-childs-bus-selected-for-the-pilot">5. How was my child’s bus selected for the pilot?</h4>
<p>We wanted a good mix of different types of bus routes where the stops are close together or far apart. Moreover, we wanted to test with bus drivers who were using different types of mobile devices. Other than these factors, it was a random decision.</p>

<h4 id="6-will-this-cause-my-bus-fares-to-increase">6. Will this cause my bus fares to increase?</h4>
<p>No, the cost of the application development is fully borne by MOE and will not affect the operating cost of the bus company.</p>

<h4 id="7-would-the-design-of-the-app-be-improved">7. Would the design of the app be improved?</h4>
<p>Please let us know your problems with the current design at <a href="mailto:schoolbus@estl.sg">schoolbus@estl.sg</a>.</p>
